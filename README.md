# Naviteri-HTML
A blog copy of Na'viteri.org for offline use.

This file is written to 100% in HTML with very few Javascript code that is used for the hide/show text function in this file. This file is designed to work on almost any devices (personal computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.). One just need a program or app that is able to render HMTL files such as standard browsers. To get the best results, you should use a browser that can handle with HTML5 (important for audio and video materials).

### Using this file</b>
To navigate in this file, just use the "Table of Content" in the header (just move your mouse over the text) and a list of available content will be shown.
If your HTML renderer has a search function, use it for searching. It should work without any problem.
Together with this file, there should be also a folder called "Naviteri" that contains all the audio, video and images for this file. This file works without them, but then without audio, video and images that is used for this file - only text will be shown.

Tipp: click at the date of a blog post or comment. You will directed to the original source on Na'viteri

### Editing this file

This file is created to be editable for those users who want to add notes, or want to change something for their own preferences. As this file is written in HTML, you need an editor.
